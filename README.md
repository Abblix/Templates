## üöÄ About the Templates

**Abblix ASP.NET Core Templates** includes two powerful templates designed to simplify and accelerate your development process. These templates provide a solid foundation for building modern web applications and identity providers with ASP.NET Core.

- **ASP.NET Core WebAPI with React and Vite Template**:
This template serves as a starting point for creating an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project combined with a React frontend using TypeScript and Vite. It establishes a fundamental project structure and essential configurations, enabling developers to kickstart their applications swiftly.
- **OpenID Connect Provider Template**:
This template is tailored for building an OpenID Connect Provider using ASP.NET Core in conjunction with the Abblix OIDC Server. It includes the core configurations and components needed to set up a functional identity provider, streamlining the process for developers to implement secure authentication solutions.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin using the Abblix ASP.NET Core Templates, ensure that your development environment is properly set up with the following tools:

- **[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)**: This SDK is essential for building and running ASP.NET Core applications. It includes the necessary compilers, libraries, and tools to develop, test, and deploy your applications. Make sure to download and install the latest version to fully leverage the capabilities of the templates.
- **[Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)**: Node.js is required to manage the frontend dependencies for projects using React and Vite. npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js and is used to install and manage these dependencies. Having Node.js and npm installed ensures that you can seamlessly integrate and build the frontend parts of your application, especially when using modern JavaScript frameworks and tools like React and Vite.

## üìù Installing the Templates

To start using the Abblix ASP.NET Core Templates, install them in your development environment either from NuGet or a local `.nupkg` file.

### From NuGet

If the template is published on NuGet, run:

```shell
# Install the template package from NuGet
dotnet new install Abblix.Templates
```

This command downloads and installs the latest version of the templates directly from NuGet.

### From a Local `.nupkg` File

If you have a local `.nupkg` file, run:

```shell
# Install the template from the local .nupkg file
# Replace "path/to/Abblix.Templates.1.0.0.nupkg" with the actual file path
# This lets you install and test the template locally before publishing it to NuGet
dotnet new install path/to/Abblix.Templates.1.0.0.nupkg
```
